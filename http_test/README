This test app is designed to serve as a simple implementation of the endpoints required by the key counter system.

It requires `node` and `npm` to be installed on the system.

To install this test app run `npm install`. To run it, use `node app`.

The app will simply output the passed user data. It's the simplest implementation that could work. It can be used to tests that:

    * A "count" field must be passed in the POST data.
    * A 202 must be returned if data has good shape.
    * Only certain users could be listened to (this is not required).
